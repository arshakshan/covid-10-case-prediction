# COVID-19 Case Prediction and Analysis

##  Overview

This Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed analysis and pre diction of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases and deaths using various machine learning models. The analysis utilizes data from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dataset.

## Structure
The notebook is structured as follows:

- Importing Libraries: Necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn are imported.
- Data Loading: COVID-19 confirmed cases and death reports are loaded from the Johns Hopkins University GitHub repository.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand trends and patterns.
- Model Building: Implementing various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Predictions: Using the models to predict future COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and discussing potential improvements.

## Getting Started

To run this notebook, you will need to have the following packages installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Data Sources
The data used in this analysis is sourced from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 GitHub repository.

### Usage

- Clone the repository or download the notebook.
- Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
- Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

### Results
The notebook provides visualizations and predictions for COVID-19 cases and deaths. The performance of different models is evaluated, and the best-performing model is used for making predictions.
